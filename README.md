🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe (Python Console Version)

This project is a simple, clean, and beginner-friendly implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python functions. Two players (X and O) take turns playing on a 3×3 board until someone wins or the game ends in a draw.

⸻

📌 How the Program Works
	•	The game board is stored as a 3×3 list.
	•	Players choose a row and column to place their mark.
	•	The program:
	•	Prints the board
	•	Validates user input
	•	Checks rows, columns, and diagonals for a winner
	•	Detects draws when the board is full
	•	Switches turns between X and O
	•	The game continues until a winner or draw is detected.

⸻

⭐ Features
	•	Fully functional two-player console game
	•	Clean and readable structure
	•	Uses separate functions for:
	•	Printing the board
	•	Checking winners
	•	Checking board status
	•	Running the main game loop
	•	Prevents invalid or repeated moves
	•	Easy to run and easy to modify

🧠 Skills You Can Practice with This Code
	•	Python functions
	•	Conditional logic (if/else)
	•	Lists and nested lists
	•	Loops and input handling
	•	Game logic and state management
	•	Code organization and clean structure
